[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/polyfills/array-find/v)](https://packagist.org/packages/polyfills/array-find) [![License](https://poser.pugx.org/polyfills/array-find/license)](https://packagist.org/packages/polyfills/array-find) [![PHP Version Require](https://poser.pugx.org/polyfills/array-find/require/php)](https://packagist.org/packages/polyfills/array-find)

Provides user-land PHP polyfills for the `array_find`, `array_find_key`, `array_any` and `array_all` functions added in PHP 8.4.

Requires PHP 7.1 or later. Not supported on PHP 8.4 because these functions are natively implemented in PHP 8.4.

## Installation

```bash
composer require polyfills/array-find
```

## Usage

Simply use the `array_find`, `array_find_key`, `array_any` and `array_all` functions as if they were declared already.
